Problem Statement 

Creative professionals needed their fonts and creative projects to come together to create an organized visual map of all the things that they were working on. So to better manage the font needs of the user, a solution was required which would cater to requirements such as: 

Managing user's creative projects 

Sharing of these creative projects among themselves. 

Access control of imported fonts. 

 

Problem Solution 

AMS was built to manage all types of user’s asset. These assets could be a FOLDER, WEB PROJECT, DIGITAL AD or FONTLIST .  

Some of the functionalities that AMS caters are: 

My Library Page: Create or Delete any kind of asset, Add font to an asset.. 

Maintains asset’s depth (asset_level) and hierarchy (asset_path) 

Asset Sharing: Share assets with a user, group or company-wide. MyLibrary: Asset Access, Asset Sharing and Permissions  

Font Access: Sharing information of an Imported Font of the customer. ( assetType = Product )
